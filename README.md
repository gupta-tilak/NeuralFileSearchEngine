In Greek mythology, _Coeus_ was the Titan-god of the inquisitive mind, his name meaning "query" or "questioning"

## _Neural File Search Engine_

![CoeuSearch-Demo](https://github.com/gupta-tilak/NeuralFileSearchEngine/blob/main/Documentation/CoeuSearch-Demo.gif)

CoeuSearch is an NLP based intelligent local-file search engine that searches for relevant text documents in a specific folder, considering the semantics of the file’s name & it's content and returns the most relevant files.

#### Input
- Search Directory: Location of folder to be searched
- Search Query: Phrase/keywords to be searched

#### Output
- Relevant Files: Location of top matched files

#### Files Supported
- File Content: .docx, .txt, .pdf, .ppt, .csv
- File Name: ALL including images, audio and video files

### _System Design_

## Getting Started

Download or clone this repository on your system.

### Prerequisites
```
- PYTHON >= 3.8.1
- DJANGO >= 1.1.2
```
### Installing
- Install python3 on your system
- Add python to environment variables
- Navigate to 'CoeuSearch' folder in terminal 
- Create an evironment using the following command -> python3 -m venv venv
- Activate the evironment using the following command  
```
     .\venv\Scripts\activate    (For Windows)
      source venv\bin\activate  (For Ubuntu)
      source venv/bin/activate  (For MacOS) 
```
- Run command ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
- Change ```cache_base_path``` in configs.py according to your machine path
- Run command ```python3 manage.py runserver```
- Click on localhost link generated after execution of previous command

## Future Work
> - Extend this tool to a multi-modal search engine that supports image, audio and video data by utilising Vision Transformers and Automatic Speech Recognition.
> - Enable multilingual search queries by using pre-trained language models like mBERT and XLM
> - Improve inference speed by using ![Efficient Nearest Neighbor Search for Cross-Encoder Models using Matrix Factorization](https://github.com/iesl/anncur) for semantic similarity
